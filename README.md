# OpenAI Function Calling Demo

This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a simple chat interface where the assistant can make function calls. This functionality is showcased by asking GPT-3.5-turbo for the current weather in a given location, which results in a function call to a mock weather API.

## Demo

You can interact with the model by typing in a message and sending it. The assistant will respond accordingly. Try asking "What's the weather like in some city?"

Please note that the weather API used in this demo is a mock and always returns the same weather data.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Precautions

Please be cautious with your OpenAI API key! Do not share it or publish it online.
